For users :
  To run ImageJ with all its plugins :
    - under WINDOWS : you can run the .bat or the .exe file in this directory
    - under Mac or Linux  : open a terminal and change your directory to the one where you put imageJ and run "bash run" in the terminal
    
  ! If you had this plugin to your own ImageJ directory : We strongly advice to use ImageJ 1.45s or higher (but it has not been tested with higher version).
  ! If you don't success the run of ImageJ or the plugin SupavisioJ check your version of Java (need to be 1.7).
  
  In the directory plugins, the files .java under the SupavisioJ directory, the lib directory and the file Supavisio_J.java are under the GPL v3.0 LICENCE
  (For more details see the LICENCE and COPYING files).

  
For developers : 
  Java 1.7 is required.
  You can open the directory containing ImageJ as a NetBeans Project (NetBeans--> Open a project). 
  Compilation :
      All sources .java of SupavisioJ can be compiled from netbeans 7.4. (the easiest way)
      You can also compiled in a terminal by :
          1- move to the plugins directory using the terminal
          2- under Linux :  javac -cp .:./lib/jfreechart.jar:./lib/jcommon.jar:./lib/ij.jar:./lib ./SupavisioJ/resources/lib/file.java 
            under Windows : path\javac.exe -cp .;.\lib\jfreechart.jar;.\lib\jcommon.jar;.\lib\ij.jar;.\lib .\SupavisioJ\resources\lib\myfile.java
          NB : if you want use all the features proposed by jfreechart you have to use all the .jar in plugins/lib
  You can access to the Javadoc using resources/classDiagram.html.
